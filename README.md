# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my implementations of basic sorting algorithms as part of my self-guided programming journey. Each file represents one algorithm, written from scratch in Python.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**<br>
  A basic comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if needed.

- **Insertion Sort**<br>
  Builds the final sorted list one item at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position in the sorted part.

- **Bogo Sort**<br>
  A chaotic and inefficient sort that randomly shuffles the list until it happens to be sorted. Implemented for fun and learning purposes only.

## How to Use

Run any script using:

```bash
python bubble_sort.py
```

Or open and modify the list directly in the file. Each script runs independently.
