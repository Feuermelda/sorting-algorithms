# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my implementations of basic sorting algorithms as part of my self-guided programming journey. Each file represents one algorithm, written from scratch in Python.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**<br>
  A basic comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if needed.

- **Insertion Sort**<br>
  Builds the final sorted list one item at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position in the sorted part.

- **Bogo Sort**<br>
  A chaotic and inefficient sort that randomly shuffles the list until it happens to be sorted. Implemented for fun and learning purposes only.

- **Merge Sort**<br>
  Recursively splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them back together in sorted order.

- **Selection Sort**<br>
  A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the list and swaps it into its correct position.

- **Lexicographic Permuation Sort**<br>
  A permutation-based sort that shuffles through parallel realities (via `itertools.permutations`) until the sorted one is observed.

## How to Use

To run an algorithm, use for example:

```bash
python bubble_sort.py
```

Or open and modify the list directly in the file. Each script runs independently.

## Performance
Time all algorithms and see which one is the fastest (coming soon)
